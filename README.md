In this repo, I will be exploring the solana web3.js library

1. solana-test-validator in terminal starts a local blockchain
2. solana-keygen-new --force creates a new key
3. take the address produced, and 'cat' into it, to find the private key, a binary, list of digits.
4. Open Phantom and import this wallet to be able to visualize the transactions better.
5. Open Solana explorer, switch from Mainnet to Custom RPC Url for localhost
6. Create a new directory through terminal. 'cd' into it and run 'npm init -y' to initialize node.js project
7. Add typescript to it. run command 'npm i --save-dev typescript'
8. create a file 'tsconfig.json'

From here, we will be doing a bunch of small projects and I would like structure each of these into a different module
